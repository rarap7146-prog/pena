# WYSIWYG Editor Cache Fix

## Problem Solved
Fixed critical bug where multiple admin users editing simultaneously would experience content overlap due to EasyMDE autosave cache conflicts.

## Root Cause
- EasyMDE autosave was enabled with same `uniqueId: 'post_content'` for all users
- localStorage cache was shared between browser sessions
- Two admins editing simultaneously would see each other's content

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Disabled Autosave
```javascript
autosave: {
    enabled: false, // Disabled to prevent cache conflicts
}
```

### 2. Cache Cleanup
Added comprehensive cache clearing on page load:
```javascript
// Clear localStorage
Object.keys(localStorage).forEach(key => {
    if (key.startsWith('easymde') || key.includes('post_content')) {
        localStorage.removeItem(key);
    }
});

// Clear sessionStorage
Object.keys(sessionStorage).forEach(key => {
    if (key.startsWith('easymde') || key.includes('post_content')) {
        sessionStorage.removeItem(key);
    }
});
```

### 3. User Warnings
Added yellow warning banners in both create and edit pages:
- Informs users that autosave is disabled
- Reminds to save work regularly
- Explains multi-user considerations

### 4. Manual Save Reminders
Implemented automatic save reminders:
- Tracks content changes
- Shows notification every 2 minutes if unsaved changes exist
- Prevents data loss without autosave

### 5. Beforeunload Protection
Added browser warnings:
- Warns when leaving with unsaved changes
- Clears cache before page unload
- Prevents accidental data loss
